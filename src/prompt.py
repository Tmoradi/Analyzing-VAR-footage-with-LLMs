PDF_PROMPT = ''' 
    Given a text from a pdf that contains the rules and regulations of the English Premier League, organize the rules so they can be stored in a text file for 
    referees and trainees to use. Make sure you follow the language that is in the pdf, as this can impact how referees interpret the rules 
    during matches.
